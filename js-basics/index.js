//Comment this is my first js code!
//console.log("hello world!");

// you can use let or var to declare a variable but its recommended to use let
let name = "MM";
console.log(name);

// nameing conventions: cant be reserved keyword (lowkey duh) 
// names should be meaningful not x, y ect...
// cant start with numbers in js, ex: 1name
// cant contain spaces or hyphens (-) 
// js uses cammelCase
// variable names are case sensitive
// you can techincally instanciate variables on the same line but dont for readability

let firstName = "Molly"
let lastName = "Masalskis"

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
